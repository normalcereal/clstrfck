# clstrfck
clstrfck -- a simple encoder that reduces textual english word length using a consistent, static, ruleset. Originally created to reduce the number of tokens used in text generation so as to increase information density in text generation priming and prompting, whilst outputting text that decodes to a significantly greater length than previously possible. First used for fine-tuning in language models, then used for prompting, assuming the language model can -- for the most part -- connect the relativistic linguistic dots for the shorter token lengths in the vocabulary.
